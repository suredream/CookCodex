# TerraMind AI Co-Pilot (Powered by CookCodex)

**TerraMind is a collaborative geospatial analysis co-pilot, powered by a team of specialized AI agents, designed to turn high-level user goals into executable Google Earth Engine code.**

This project aims to lower the barrier to entry for complex geospatial analysis by providing an intelligent, interactive, and reliable AI partner. It is built using the **CookCodex** development methodology.

## Core Features

-   **Intelligent Guardrail**: Automatically validates user queries for scope and capability.
-   **Collaborative Planning**: Engages in a dialogue with the user to create a detailed, structured analysis plan.
-   **Automated Code Generation**: Translates the approved plan into executable GEE Python code.
-   **Cost-Awareness**: Provides a high-level cost estimation for the generated code.
