# Feature Spec: CookCodex Initial Vision

-   **Status**: Draft
-   **Owner**: [Your Name]

## 1. Problem Statement
Developers and teams need a simple, maintainable way to publish CookCodex project documentation directly from their Markdown files in a Git repository.

## 2. Proposed Solution
A documentation-first workflow system that uses a pre-defined directory structure.
-   All documentation lives in the `/docs` folder.
-   A static site generator (like MkDocs) will be used to build a beautiful, navigable website from the Markdown files. Please note: ignore all markdown files starting with `_`, which are used for internal purposes.
-   A GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages on every push to the `main` branch.

## 3. Key Features
-   Automated deployment.
-   Easy local preview.
-   Based on the `CookCodex` methodology for maintainability.
